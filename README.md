# Challenge â€“ Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Falabella". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Integraciones".
But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or `else`.
